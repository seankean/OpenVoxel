Packet Structure www.ti.com 


Figure 1. DLP® LightCrafter™ Block Diagram 

The DLP® LightCrafter™ module runs and embedded Linux kernel. A PC host communicates with DLP® 
LightCrafter™ through USB. When the LightCrafter module is connected to the PC through USB, the 
LightCrafter enumerates as a virtual ethernet device over USB. The virtual network on the PC is assigned 
IP address 192.168.1.99 while the LightCrafter module is assigned the IP address 192.168.1.100. 
LightCrafter uses the Remote Netword Driver Interface Specification (RNDIS) protocol to exchange TCP 
packets (Ethernet over USB emulation). The command packets are received on TCP port number 0x5555. 
Each command packet may either be sent on a single TCP packet or split accross multiple TCP packets. 
The TCP packets received by LightCrafter are interpreted by an application running on the DM365. 

The following sections describe the packet and command structure to control the DLP® LightCrafter™ 
functions. 

Packet Structure 

All the commands are packetized. Each command packet is acknowledged by a response packet. The 
host must wait for the packet response before sending another command packet. Only the host can 
initiate the packet transaction. 

A command packet consists of 6 byte header, a variable size data payload and a checksum byte.

www.ti.com Packet Structure 

2.1 Packet Type 
The first byte defines the type of the packet: 
0x00 – LightCrafter System Busy Packet 
0x01 – LightCrafter Error Packet 
0x02 – Host Write Command Packet 
0x03 – LightCrafter Write Response Packet 
0x04 – Host Read Command Packet 
0x05 – LightCrafter Read Response Packet 


2.1.1 LightCrafter System Busy Packet [Packet Type 0x00] 
LightCrafter may send a System Busy Packet as a response to a Host's Write/Read command. It indicates 
that the LightCrafter system has not completed the previous command or is busy performing some other 
operation. This response has no data, so the data length of this packet is zero. All the bytes in the packet, 
except the first one, are ignored. 

2.1.2 LightCrafter Error Packet [Packet Type 0x01] 
LightCrafter may send an Error Packet as a response to a Host's Write/Read command. It indicates that 
there is an error in interpreting/executing the command. The error is passed in the data payload as one 
byte error code. There can be more than one error code in a single packet. 

The error packets are: 

0x01 – Command execution failed with unknown error 
0x02 – Invalid command 
0x03 – Invalid Parameter 
0x04 – Out of memory resource 
0x04 – Hardware device failure 
0x05 – Hardware busy 
0x06 – Not Initialized (any of the preconditions for the command is not met) 
0x07 – Some object referred by the command is not found. For example, a solution name was not 

found. 
0x08 – Checksum Error 
0x09 – Packet format error due to insufficient or larger than expected payload size 
0x0A – Command continuation error due to incorrect continuation flag 


2.1.3 Host Write Command Packet [Packet Type 0x02] 
A host Write Command sends configuration information to the LightCrafter module. The data payload 
contains the parameters of the command. 

2.1.4 LightCrafter Write Response Packet [Packet Type 0x03] 
The LightCrafter sends a write response packet to the host to indicate successful execution. The CMD1 
and CMD2 are same as the corresponding Write Command. This packet has no data payload. 

2.1.5 Host Read Command Packet [Packet Type 0x04] 
A host Read Command requests information from the LightCrafter module. The information requested is 
identified using the CMD2 and CMD3. Any additional parameter is passed in the data payload. 

2.1.6 LightCrafter Read Response Packet [Packet Type 0x05] 
The LightCrafter sends a Read Response packet to the host as a response to a host Read Command. 
The CMD1 and CMD2 are same as the corresponding read command. The data payload has non-zero 
length and contains the requested information.

2.2 Command ID (CMD1 & CMD2) 
CMD1 and CMD2 together form a unique ID for the command. The list of commands supported by the 
LightCrafter module is explained in Section 3 

The CMD1 identifies the main command number and CMD2 describes the sub command number. 

2.3 Payload Length (L1 & L2) 
The bytes L1 and L2 represent the data length excluding checksum. L1 corresponds to the LSB while L2 
corresponds to the MSB. 

2.4 Data Payload 
The data related to the current command. The data length and content will vary depending on the 
command. The maximum data payload size is 65535 bytes. 

2.5 Checksum 
This byte is used for verifying the integrity of the command packet. It is the sum of all the bytes in the 
current packet, not including the checksum byte. 

Checksum = (Byte 0 + Byte 1 + … Byte N) MODULO[ 0x100 ] 

2.6 Command Flags 
The command interpreter utilizes the flags to understand and follow the transfer of data through multiple 
command and response packets. The flags are: 
0x00 – The packet payload contains the complete data 
0x01 – The packet payload contains the beginning of the data 
0x02 – The packet payload contains the intermediate data 
0x03 – The packet payload contains the last data 

3 Command Specification 

The following sections define the list of commands and their corresponding data payloads as supported by 
the LightCrafter module. The command number is the hex representation of CMD1 and CMD2 bytes. All

IMPORTANT NOTICE 


Texas Instruments Incorporated and its subsidiaries (TI) reserve the right to make corrections, modifications, enhancements, improvements, 
and other changes to its products and services at any time and to discontinue any product or service without notice. Customers should 
obtain the latest relevant information before placing orders and should verify that such information is current and complete. All products are 
sold subject to TI’s terms and conditions of sale supplied at the time of order acknowledgment. 

TI warrants performance of its hardware products to the specifications applicable at the time of sale in accordance with TI’s standard 
warranty. Testing and other quality control techniques are used to the extent TI deems necessary to support this warranty. Except where 
mandated by government requirements, testing of all parameters of each product is not necessarily performed. 

TI assumes no liability for applications assistance or customer product design. Customers are responsible for their products and 
applications using TI components. To minimize the risks associated with customer products and applications, customers should provide 
adequate design and operating safeguards. 

TI does not warrant or represent that any license, either express or implied, is granted under any TI patent right, copyright, mask work right, 
or other TI intellectual property right relating to any combination, machine, or process in which TI products or services are used. Information 
published by TI regarding third-party products or services does not constitute a license from TI to use such products or services or a 
warranty or endorsement thereof. Use of such information may require a license from a third party under the patents or other intellectual 
property of the third party, or a license from TI under the patents or other intellectual property of TI. 

Reproduction of TI information in TI data books or data sheets is permissible only if reproduction is without alteration and is accompanied 
by all associated warranties, conditions, limitations, and notices. Reproduction of this information with alteration is an unfair and deceptive 
business practice. TI is not responsible or liable for such altered documentation. Information of third parties may be subject to additional 
restrictions. 

Resale of TI products or services with statements different from or beyond the parameters stated by TI for that product or service voids all 
express and any implied warranties for the associated TI product or service and is an unfair and deceptive business practice. TI is not 
responsible or liable for any such statements. 

TI products are not authorized for use in safety-critical applications (such as life support) where a failure of the TI product would reasonably 
be expected to cause severe personal injury or death, unless officers of the parties have executed an agreement specifically governing 
such use. Buyers represent that they have all necessary expertise in the safety and regulatory ramifications of their applications, and 
acknowledge and agree that they are solely responsible for all legal, regulatory and safety-related requirements concerning their products 
and any use of TI products in such safety-critical applications, notwithstanding any applications-related information or support that may be 
provided by TI. Further, Buyers must fully indemnify TI and its representatives against any damages arising out of the use of TI products in 
such safety-critical applications. 

TI products are neither designed nor intended for use in military/aerospace applications or environments unless the TI products are 
specifically designated by TI as military-grade or "enhanced plastic." 
Only products designated by TI as military-grade meet military 
specifications. Buyers acknowledge and agree that any such use of TI products which TI has not designated as military-grade is solely at 
the Buyer's risk, and that they are solely responsible for compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements in connection with such use. 

TI products are neither designed nor intended for use in automotive applications or environments unless the specific TI products are 
designated by TI as compliant with ISO/TS 16949 requirements. Buyers acknowledge and agree that, if they use any non-designated 
products in automotive applications, TI will not be responsible for any failure to meet such requirements.
