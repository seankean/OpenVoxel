	Alternatively to build the release:
	-From a Visual Studio command prompt run:
	-qmake
	-nmake release
	or use jom if installed
	-jom -j4 release

Linux: Run qmake && make


Mac: qmake && make

Running VoxiePlayer:

	-Extract the imagesets.zip file into the directory with the binary
	
	Windows: 
	
		-Run any of the batch scripts
	
	Linux & Mac: 
	
		-Copy the commands out of the batch scripts 
		-Run from command line
